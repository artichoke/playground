# Contributing to Artichoke

üëã Hi and welcome to [Artichoke]. Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
üí™üíéüôå

The Artichoke Playground is a WebAssembly frontend to [Artichoke Ruby] that lets
you experiment with the language in the browser. [There is lots to do].

If the Artichoke Playground does not run Ruby source code in the same way that
MRI does, it is a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can
fix it]. [File bugs specific to the Playground in this repository].

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR. [Good first issues are labeled
`E-easy`].

## Setup

The Artichoke Playground includes Rust, Ruby, and Text sources. Developing on
the Artichoke Playground requires configuring several dependencies, which are
orchestrated by Rake.

### Rust Toolchain

The Artichoke Playground depends on stable Rust and several compiler plugins for
linting and formatting. The specific version of Rust Artichoke requires is
specified in the [toolchain file](rust-toolchain.toml).

#### Installation

The recommended way to install the Rust toolchain is with [rustup]. On macOS,
you can install rustup with [Homebrew]:

```sh
brew install rustup-init
rustup-init
```

On Windows, you can install rustup from the official site and follow the
prompts: <https://rustup.rs/>. This requires a download of Visual Studio (the
[Community Edition][vs-community] is sufficient) and several C++ packages
selected through the VS component installer. (I'm not sure which packages are
required; I selected them all.)

When running any subsequent `cargo` commands, rustup will ensure the correct
version of the toolchain is installed.

It is recommended to install `rustfmt` and `clippy` to help with static code
analysis and to do relevant checks prior to submitting PRs.

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt clippy
```

### Rust Crates

The playground depends on several Rust libraries. In Rust, a library is called a
_crate_. Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install the crates
specified in [`Cargo.lock`](Cargo.lock) by running:

```sh
cargo build
```

You can check to see that this worked by running the following and observing no
errors:

```sh
cargo test
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

### C Toolchain

The Playground's `artichoke` dependency and several other transitive
dependencies build C static libraries and require a C compiler.

The Artichoke Playground specifically requires emcc. Install the appropriate
emscripten toolchain defined in [`emscripten-toolchain`](emscripten-toolchain)
or source the included helper in your shell:

```sh
. scripts/install-emscripten-toolchain.sh
```

#### `cc` Crate

Artichoke and some of its dependencies use the Rust [`cc` crate] to build. `cc`
uses a [platform-dependent C compiler] to compile C sources. On Unix, `cc` crate
uses the `cc` binary.

#### mruby Backend

To build the Artichoke mruby backend, you will need a C compiler toolchain. By
default, mruby requires the following to compile:

- clang
- ar

You can override the requirement for clang by setting the `CC` and `LD`
environment variables.

### Ruby

The Artichoke Playground requires a recent Ruby and [bundler] for development
tasks. The [`.ruby-version`](.ruby-version) file in this repository specifies
the preferred Ruby toolchain.

If you use [RVM], you can install Ruby dependencies by running:

```sh
rvm install "$(cat .ruby-version)"
gem install bundler
```

If you use [rbenv] and [ruby-build], you can install Ruby dependencies by
running:

```sh
rbenv install "$(cat .ruby-version)"
gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
```

The [`Gemfile`](Gemfile) in Artichoke specifies several dev dependencies. You
can install these dependencies by running:

```sh
bundle install
```

Artichoke uses [`rake`](Rakefile) as a task runner. You can see the available
tasks by running:

```console
$ bundle exec rake --tasks
rake build                         # Build Rust workspace
rake bundle:audit:check            # Checks the Gemfile.lock for insecure dependencies
rake bundle:audit:update           # Updates the bundler-audit vulnerability database
rake doc                           # Generate Rust API documentation
rake doc:open                      # Generate Rust API documentation and open it in a web browser
rake fmt                           # Format sources
rake fmt:rust                      # Format Rust sources with rustfmt
rake fmt:text                      # Format text, YAML, and Markdown sources with prettier
rake format                        # Format sources
rake format:rust                   # Format Rust sources with rustfmt
rake format:text                   # Format text, YAML, and Markdown sources with prettier
rake lint                          # Lint sources
rake lint:clippy                   # Lint Rust sources with Clippy
rake lint:clippy:restriction       # Lint Rust sources with Clippy restriction pass (unenforced lints)
rake lint:eslint                   # Lint JavaScript and TypeScript sources with eslint
rake lint:rubocop                  # Run RuboCop
rake lint:rubocop:autocorrect      # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)
rake lint:rubocop:autocorrect_all  # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (safe and unsafe)
rake release:markdown_link_check   # Check for broken links in markdown files
rake test                          # Run Playground unit tests
```

To lint Ruby sources, the playground uses [RuboCop]. RuboCop runs as part of the
`lint` task. You can run only RuboCop by invoking the `lint:rubocop` task.

### Python

Python is required for installing [emsdk], which is used for building on
WebAssembly targets.

On Windows, install the latest Python release from:
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>.

### Node.js

Node.js is required for bundling the webapp with vite and testing in
development.

Node.js is also required for formatting if modifying the following filetypes:

- `html`
- `js`
- `json`
- `md`
- `yaml`
- `yml`

You will need to install [Node.js].

On macOS, you can install Node.js with [Homebrew]:

```sh
brew install node
```

### Node.js Packages

Once you have Node.js installed, you can install the packages specified in
[`package.json`](package.json) by running:

```sh
npm ci
```

## Code Quality

### Linting

Once you [configure a development environment](#setup), run the following to
lint sources:

```sh
rake lint
```

Merges will be blocked by CI if there are lint errors.

## Updating Dependencies

### Rust Toolchain

The rust-toolchain can be bumped to the latest stable compiler by editing the
[`rust-toolchain`](rust-toolchain.toml) file. This file is automatically picked
up by local builds and CI.

### Rust Crates

Version specifiers in `Cargo.toml` are NPM caret-style by default. A version
specifier of `4.1.2` means `4.1.2 <= version < 5.0.0`.

To see what crates are outdated, you can use [cargo-outdated].

If you need to pull in an updated version of a crate for a bugfix or a new
feature, update the version number in `Cargo.toml`. See
[artichoke/artichoke#548] for an example.

Regular dependency bumps are handled by [@dependabot].

### Artichoke

The Artichoke Playground pegs a version of `artichoke-backend` from the main
Artichoke repository by git hash. To update the version of Artichoke deployed to
the playground, update this hash in [`Cargo.toml`](playground/Cargo.toml).
