You can [try Artichoke in your browser][playground]. The [Artichoke
Playground][playground-repo] runs a [WebAssembly] build of
[Artichoke][artichoke-repo].

If you would prefer to run a local build of the playground, you can
[set up a Rust toolchain](CONTRIBUTING.md#rust-toolchain) and a launch local
development server with:

```sh
npm ci
. scripts/install-emscripten-toolchain.sh
npm run dev:debug # or npm run dev:release
```

## Contributing

Artichoke aspires to be an [MRI Ruby-compatible][mri-target] implementation of
the Ruby programming language. [There is lots to do][github-issues].

If the Artichoke Playground does not run Ruby source code in the same way that
MRI does, it is a bug and we would appreciate if you [filed an issue so we can
fix it][file-an-issue].

If you would like to contribute code üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª, find an issue that looks interesting
and leave a comment that you're beginning to investigate. If there is no issue,
please file one before beginning to work on a PR. [Good first issues are labeled
`E-easy`][e-easy].
